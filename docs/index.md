# Second Brain Digest

**AI-powered daily digests from your Obsidian vault**

Second Brain Digest transforms your Obsidian vault into a source of daily insights. Each morning (or whatever time you choose), receive a personalized email highlighting what's changed, discovering hidden connections, and resurfacing forgotten notes.

It's time to actually use that large vault you've built!

## What You'll Get

Second Brain Digest contains several different modules that can be enabled or disabled or (coming soon) customized. These include:

- **Daily Recap** - A summary of your recent note activity with AI-generated insights
- **Complementary Insights** - Discover how your recent edits connect to older notes you may have forgotten
- **Connections & Crosslinks** - Find related notes through tags, links, and content similarity
- **Random Resurfaced Note** - Rediscover older notes that might spark new ideas
- **This Day in History** - See what you were writing about on this date in previous years

## How It Works

1. **Install the Obsidian Plugin** - Securely sync your vault data to Second Brain Digest
2. **Configure Your Preferences** - Choose which modules to include and set your delivery schedule
3. **Receive Daily Digests** - Get personalized insights delivered to your inbox

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Insights
Using advanced AI, Second Brain Digest identifies patterns, connections, and insights that would be difficult to spot manually.

### Customizable
Enable or disable individual modules, reorder them, and configure how often you receive digests.

### Privacy-Focused
Choose if you want notes excluded from the service in the plugin before they even leave your vault. Everything you do choose to include in your digest is encrypted and secure.

### Works With Your Workflow
Second Brain Digest reads your vault but never modifies your notes. Your existing Obsidian workflow stays exactly the same.
