# Daily Recap

The Daily Recap module provides a summary of your recent vault activity, highlighting what you've been working on and offering AI-generated insights.

## What It Shows

### Activity Summary

An AI-generated overview of your recent note activity, identifying:

- Themes and topics you've been exploring
- Patterns in your writing
- Connections between recent work

### Recently Touched Notes

A list of the top 5 notes you've created or modified recently, including:

- Note title
- When it was last modified
- Brief excerpt or summary

## How It Works

1. **Change Detection** - The module identifies notes modified since your last digest
2. **Analysis** - Recent changes are analyzed for themes and patterns
3. **Summary Generation** - AI creates a natural language summary of your activity
4. **Note Selection** - The most recently touched notes are highlighted

## Example Output

>
> Over the past day, you've been focused on project planning and research. Your notes show a pattern of connecting ideas from multiple sources into actionable tasks. The "Q1 Goals" note has been particularly active, with several updates linking to related project notes.

## Configuration

### AI Mode

With AI enabled:

- Summaries are contextual and insightful
- Themes are identified semantically
- Connections between notes are highlighted

### Rule-Based Mode

Without AI:

- Shows a simple list of recently modified notes
- Basic metadata (titles, dates)
- No thematic analysis

## Tips for Best Results

### Regular Note-Taking

The more actively you use your vault, the more valuable this module becomes. Regular updates give it more to analyze.

### Meaningful Note Titles

Clear, descriptive titles help the AI generate better summaries and make the recent notes list more useful.

### Frontmatter Dates

If you use creation/modification dates in frontmatter, the module can use these for more accurate change detection.
