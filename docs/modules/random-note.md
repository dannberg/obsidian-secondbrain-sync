# Random Resurfaced Note

The Random Note module brings a forgotten note back to your attention. It's designed to spark new ideas by resurfacing content you may not have thought about in a while.

## What It Shows

A single note from your vault that:

- You created at least some time ago
- You haven't seen in a recent digest
- Might benefit from review or connection to current work

The module displays:

- Note title
- Creation date
- Brief excerpt or summary
- Why it was selected (if relevant)

## How It Works

1. **Candidate Selection** - Identifies notes that haven't been shown recently
2. **Filtering** - Removes notes that are too recent or excluded
3. **Random Selection** - Picks one note from eligible candidates
4. **Tracking** - Records the shown note to avoid repeats

### 60-Day Window

To ensure variety, the module tracks which notes have been shown and won't repeat a note for 60 days. This means:

- Each digest shows a different note
- Over time, you'll see your entire vault
- Recently shown notes are automatically excluded

## Example Output

> **Resurfaced Note**
>
> **"Ideas for Blog Posts"**
> Created: March 15, 2023
>
> > A collection of potential blog post ideas including:
> > - The value of maintaining a second brain
> > - How I use daily reviews
> > - Connecting notes across projects...
>
> *You haven't seen this note in 47 days*

## Configuration

### Exclusions

You can exclude certain notes from random selection:

- Notes in excluded folders won't be selected
- Notes with excluded tags won't appear
- Very recent notes (created in the last few days) are typically skipped

### Age Preferences

The module tends to favor older notes that you're more likely to have forgotten, while still occasionally surfacing newer content.

## Why This Matters

### Combat Recency Bias

We naturally focus on recent work. Random resurfacing ensures older notes get attention too.

### Spark Unexpected Connections

A note from months ago might suddenly become relevant to current work. You won't know unless you see it.

### Review and Prune

Seeing old notes helps you identify what's still valuable and what can be archived or deleted.

## Tips for Best Results

### Don't Skip It

Even if the note seems irrelevant at first glance, take a moment to read it. Unexpected connections often emerge.

### Act on Insights

If the resurfaced note sparks an idea:

- Link it to current notes
- Update it with new context
- Create a new note with the connection

### Use Exclusions Wisely

Only exclude folders/tags that truly shouldn't be resurfaced. The more notes in the pool, the more variety you'll see.

### Track Patterns

Notice if certain types of notes keep feeling irrelevant. This might indicate content that should be archived or better organized.
