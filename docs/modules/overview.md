# Digest Modules Overview

Your daily digest is composed of modules - independent sections that each provide different insights into your vault. You can enable, disable, and reorder modules to create the perfect digest for your workflow.

## Available Modules

| Module | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| [Daily Recap](daily-recap.md) | Summarizes recent activity with AI-generated insights |
| [Complementary Insights](complementary-info.md) | Connects recent edits to related older notes |
| [Connections & Crosslinks](connections.md) | Finds related notes through links, tags, and structure |
| [Random Resurfaced Note](random-note.md) | Brings back a forgotten note that might spark new ideas |
| [This Day in History](todays-history.md) | Shows notes created on this date in previous years |

## How Modules Work

Each module independently analyzes your vault and generates a section for your digest:

1. **Analysis** - The module examines your vault data (recent changes, note content, metadata)
2. **Selection** - It identifies notes or patterns relevant to its purpose
3. **Generation** - It creates a formatted section with insights
4. **Assembly** - All enabled modules are combined into your final digest

## Configuring Modules

### Enable/Disable Modules

1. Go to **Settings** in your dashboard
2. Find the **Modules** section
3. Toggle each module on or off
4. Save your changes

Disabled modules won't appear in your digest.

### Reorder Modules

Control the order sections appear:

1. Go to **Settings > Modules**
2. Drag modules to reorder them
3. The first module appears at the top of your digest
4. Save your changes

### Module-Specific Settings

Some modules have their own configuration options - see each module's documentation page for details.

## AI vs Rule-Based Analysis

Modules can work in two modes:

### AI-Powered (Recommended)

When AI is enabled:

- Summaries are generated using natural language
- Connections are identified semantically
- Insights are context-aware and nuanced

### Rule-Based

When AI is not configured:

- Analysis uses pattern matching and metadata
- Results are based on links, tags, and dates
- Still useful, but less nuanced than AI mode

You can configure AI settings in your account preferences.

## Best Practices

### Start With All Modules

Try all modules initially to see what resonates with your workflow, then disable ones you don't find valuable.

### Consider Your Vault Size

- **Small vaults (< 100 notes)** - Some modules may have limited content to surface
- **Large vaults (1000+ notes)** - Modules become more valuable as they can surface forgotten content

### Review and Adjust

After a week of digests, review which modules you actually read and engage with. Disable modules that don't add value to reduce digest length.
