# Complementary Insights

The Complementary Insights module discovers connections between your recent work and older notes you may have forgotten. It surfaces relevant context that could enhance your current thinking.

## What It Shows

For each recent note you've edited, this module finds older notes that:

- Share similar topics or themes
- Contain related information
- Could provide useful context or background

## How It Works

1. **Identify Recent Activity** - Finds notes you've recently created or modified
2. **Analyze Content** - Examines the topics, keywords, and themes in recent notes
3. **Search Historical Notes** - Looks through older notes for related content
4. **Rank Relevance** - Scores potential matches by relevance
5. **Present Connections** - Shows the most relevant older notes for each recent edit

## Example Output

> **Complementary Notes for Your Recent Edits**
>
> **For "Project Alpha Planning"** (edited today)
>
> You might find these older notes relevant:
>
> - **Project Beta Retrospective** (6 months ago) - Contains lessons learned that may apply to your current planning
> - **Resource Allocation Framework** (1 year ago) - Your previous framework for project staffing
>
> **For "Market Research Q1"** (edited yesterday)
>
> Consider revisiting:
>
> - **Competitor Analysis 2023** (8 months ago) - Previous competitive landscape analysis
> - **Customer Interview Notes** (4 months ago) - Direct customer feedback that may inform your research

## Why This Matters

Knowledge management tools often suffer from "write once, forget forever" syndrome. You capture valuable information but rarely revisit it. Complementary Insights actively combats this by:

- **Surfacing forgotten context** - Notes you wrote months or years ago become relevant again
- **Building on past work** - Don't reinvent the wheel when you've already captured similar ideas
- **Strengthening connections** - Discover relationships between notes you didn't realize existed

## Configuration

### AI Mode

With AI enabled:

- Semantic similarity matching
- Context-aware relevance scoring
- Natural language explanations of why notes are connected

### Rule-Based Mode

Without AI:

- Tag-based matching
- Link relationship analysis
- Keyword overlap detection

## Tips for Best Results

### Consistent Tagging

Use consistent tags across your vault. The module uses tags to find related content when semantic analysis isn't available.

### Descriptive Content

Notes with clear, descriptive content produce better matches. Bullet points and headers help the analysis.

### Don't Over-Link

If every note links to every other note, the signal gets lost in noise. Be intentional about links for better complementary suggestions.
