# Email Scheduling

Set up automated daily digests so insights arrive in your inbox without manual intervention.

## Setting Up Scheduled Digests

### Enabling Scheduling

1. Go to **Settings > Scheduling**
2. Toggle **Enable Scheduled Digests** on
3. Configure your preferred time
4. Click **Save**

### Choosing a Time

Select when you want your digest delivered:

- **Hour** - Choose the hour (0-23 in 24-hour format)
- **Minute** - Choose the minute (0-59)

Times are based on your configured timezone.

**Recommended times:**

- **Morning (6-8 AM)** - Start your day with insights from yesterday
- **Evening (6-8 PM)** - Review the day's activity before winding down

### Timezone Considerations

Your digest time is based on your account's timezone setting:

1. Go to **Settings > General**
2. Verify your timezone is correct
3. Return to scheduling settings

If you travel frequently, update your timezone to receive digests at the expected local time.

## Managing Your Schedule

### Pausing Digests

To temporarily stop receiving digests:

1. Go to **Settings > Scheduling**
2. Toggle **Enable Scheduled Digests** off
3. Your settings are preserved for when you re-enable

### Changing the Schedule

To adjust your delivery time:

1. Go to **Settings > Scheduling**
2. Update the hour and/or minute
3. Click **Save**

Changes take effect immediately for the next scheduled digest.

## Manual Digests

Even with scheduling enabled, you can generate digests on demand:

1. Go to your **Dashboard**
2. Click **Generate Digest**
3. A new digest is generated and emailed immediately

This doesn't affect your scheduled delivery.

## Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving Scheduled Digests

1. **Check spam folder** - Add our email address to your contacts
2. **Verify scheduling is enabled** - Check the toggle in settings
3. **Check your timezone** - Ensure it's set correctly
4. **Verify email address** - Make sure your email is correct in settings

### Digest Arrives at Wrong Time

1. Check your timezone setting matches your location
2. Remember times are in 24-hour format
3. Allow a few minutes variance for server processing

### Receiving Multiple Digests

If you're receiving duplicates:

1. Check you haven't manually triggered a digest near the scheduled time
2. Contact support if the issue persists
